Using the Sine-DVR basis and the two propagation methods of Splitting Operators and Chebyshev Real Wave Packet, the time-dependent wave packet evolution and the extraction and calculation of scattering probabilities for one-dimensional scattering are realized. The evolution and extraction of dynamic properties have been encapsulated into the module. The main function can define the scattering potential energy and a series of initialization parameters. The main function here gives a scattering example on the Eckart barrier.
